<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">In</span> the kingdom of Bonbobbin, which, by
the Chinese annals, appears to have flourished twenty thousand years
ago, there reigned a prince, endowed with every accomplishment which
generally distinguishes the sons of kings. His beauty was brighter than
the sun. The sun, to which he was nearly related, would sometimes stop
his course, in order to look down and admire him.</p>

<p>His mind was not less perfect than his body; he knew all things
without having ever read; philosophers, poets, and historians, submitted
their works to his decision; and
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<!-- png 5 -->
so penetrating was he, that he could tell the merit of a book by looking
on the cover. He made epic poems, tragedies, and pastorals, with
surprising facility; song, epigram, or rebus, was all one to him;
though, it is observed, he could never finish an acrostick. In short,
the fairy who presided at his birth had endowed him with almost every
perfection; or, what was just the same, his subjects were ready to
acknowledge he possessed them all; and, for his own part, he knew
nothing to the contrary. A&nbsp;prince so accomplished, received a name
suitable to his merit; and he was called
<i>Bonbenin-bonbobbin-bonbobbinet</i>, which signifies Enlightener of
the Sun.</p>

<p>As he was very powerful, and yet unmarried, all the neighbouring
kings earnestly sought his alliance. Each sent his daughter, dressed out
in the most magnificent manner, and with the most sumptuous retinue
imaginable, in order to allure the prince; so that, at one time, there
were seen at his court, not less than seven hundred foreign princesses,
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<!-- png 6 -->
of exquisite sentiment and beauty, each alone sufficient to make seven
hundred ordinary men happy.</p>

<p>Distracted in such a variety, the generous Bonbenin, had he not been
obliged by the laws of the empire to make choice of one, would very
willingly have married them all, for none understood gallantry better.
He spent numberless hours of solicitude, in endeavouring to determine
whom he should choose. One lady was possessed of every perfection, but
he disliked her eye-brows; another was brighter than the morning-star,
but he disapproved her fong-whang; a&nbsp;third did not lay enough of
white on her cheek; and a fourth did not sufficiently blacken her nails.
At last, after numberless disappointments on the one side and the other,
he made choice of the incomparable Nanhoa, queen of the Scarlet
Dragons.</p>

<p>The preparations for the royal nuptials, or the envy of the
disappointed ladies, needs no description; both the one and the other
were as great as they could be. The beautiful
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<!-- png 7 -->
princess was conducted, amidst admiring multitudes, to the royal couch,
where, after being divested of every encumbering ornament, he <ins class
= "correction" title = "text unchanged">came</ins> more chearful than
the morning; and printing on her lips a burning kiss, the attendants
took this as a proper signal to withdraw.</p>

<p>Perhaps I ought to have mentioned in the beginning, that, among
several other qualifications, the prince was fond of collecting and
breeding mice, which being an harmless pastime, none of his counsellors
thought proper to dissuade him from; he therefore kept a great variety
of these pretty little animals in the most beautiful cages, enriched
with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls, and other precious stones. Thus
he innocently spent four hours each day in contemplating their innocent
little pastimes.</p>

<p>But, to proceed, the prince and princess now retired to repose; and
though night and secrecy had drawn the curtain, yet delicacy retarded
those enjoyments which passion presented to their view. The prince
happening
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<span class = "pagenum folio">2</span>
<!-- png 8 -->
to look towards the outside of the bed, perceived one of the most
beautiful animals in the world, a&nbsp;white mouse with green eyes,
playing about the floor, and performing an hundred pretty tricks. He was
already master of blue mice, red mice, and even white mice with yellow
eyes; but a white mouse with green eyes, was what he long endeavoured to
possess: whereupon, leaping from bed, with the utmost impatience and
agility, the youthful prince attempted to seize the little charmer; but
it was fled in a moment; for, alas! the mouse was sent by a discontented
princess, and was itself a fairy.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the agony of the prince upon this
occasion. He sought round and round every part of the room, even the bed
where the princess lay was not exempt from the inquiry; he turned the
princess on one side and the other, stripped her quite naked, but no
mouse was to be found; the princess herself was kind enough to assist,
but still to no purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried the young prince in an
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<!-- png 9 -->
agony, &ldquo;how unhappy am I to be thus disappointed! never sure was
so beautiful an animal seen; I&nbsp;would give half my kingdom and my
princess to him that would find it.&rdquo; The princess, though not much
pleased with the latter part of his offer, endeavoured to comfort him as
well as she could; she let him know he had an hundred mice already,
which ought to be at least sufficient to satisfy any philosopher like
him. Though none of them had green eyes, yet he should learn to thank
Heaven that they had eyes. She told him (for she was a profound
moralist,) that incurable evils must be borne, and that useless
lamentations were vain, and that man was born to misfortunes; she even
intreated him to return to bed, and she would endeavour to lull him on
her bosom to repose; but still the prince continued inconsolable; and,
regarding her with a stern air, for which his family was remarkable, he
vowed never to sleep in a royal palace, or indulge himself in the
innocent pleasures of matrimony, till he had found the white mouse with
green eyes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<!-- png 10 -->
<p>When morning came, he published an edict, offering half his kingdom,
and his princess, to that person who should catch and bring him the
white mouse with green eyes.</p>

<p>The edict was scarce published, when all the traps in the kingdom
were baited with cheese; numberless mice were taken and destroyed, but
still the much-wished-for mouse was not among the number. The privy
council were assembled more than once to give their advice; but all
their deliberations came to nothing, even though there were two complete
vermin-killers, and three professed rat-catchers, of the number.
Frequent addresses, as is usual on extraordinary occasions, were sent
from all parts of the empire; but, though these promised well, though in
them he received an assurance that his faithful subjects would assist in
his search with their lives and fortunes, yet, with all their loyalty,
they failed, when the time came that the mouse was to be caught.</p>

<p>The prince, therefore, was resolved to go himself in search,
determined never to lie
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<!-- png 11 -->
two nights in one place, till he had found what he sought for. Thus,
quitting his palace without attendants, he set out upon his journey, and
travelled through many a desert, and crossed many a river, high over
hills, and down along vales, still restless, still inquiring wherever he
came, but no white mouse was to be found<ins class = "correction" title
= ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>As one day, fatigued with his journey, he was shading himself from
the heat of the mid-day sun, under the arching branches of a <ins class
= "correction" title = "text unchanged, but author may have intended 'Banyan'">Banana</ins>
tree, meditating on the object of his pursuit, he
perceived an old woman hideously deformed approaching him; by her stoop,
and the wrinkles of her visage, she seemed at least five hundred years
old; and the spotted toad was not more freckled than was her skin.
&ldquo;Ah! Prince Bonbenin-bonbobbin-bonbobbinet,&rdquo; cried the
creature, &ldquo;what has led you so many thousand miles from your own
kingdom? What is it you look for, and what induces you to travel into
the kingdom of the Emmets?&rdquo; The prince, who was excessively
complaisant, told her the whole story three
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<span class = "pagenum folio">3</span>
<!-- png 14 -->
times over, for she was hard of hearing. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the
old fairy, for such she was, &ldquo;I&nbsp;promise to put you in
possession of the white mouse with green eyes, and that immediately too,
upon one condition.&rdquo; &ldquo;One condition,&rdquo; replied the
prince in a rapture, &ldquo;name a thousand; I&nbsp;shall undergo them
all with pleasure.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; interrupted the old fairy,
&ldquo;I&nbsp;ask but one, and that not very mortifying neither; it is
only that you instantly consent to marry&nbsp;me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class = "illustration">

alt = "Man kneeling before young witch"></p>

<p>It is impossible to express the prince&rsquo;s confusion at this
demand; he loved the mouse, but he detested the bride; he hesitated; he
desired time to think upon the proposal. He would have been glad to
consult his friends on such an occasion. &ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; cried
the odious fairy, &ldquo;if you demur, I&nbsp;retract my promise;
I&nbsp;do not desire to force my favours on any man. Here, you my
attendants, (cried she, stamping with her foot,) let my machine be
driven up; Barbacela, queen of Emmets, is not used to contemptuous
treatment.&rdquo; She had no sooner spoken than her
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<!-- png 15 -->
fiery chariot appeared in the air, drawn by two snails; and she was just
going to step in, when the prince reflected that now or never was the
time to be in possession of the white mouse; and, quite forgetting his
lawful princess Nanhoa, falling on his knees, he implored forgiveness
for having rashly rejected so much beauty. This well-timed compliment
instantly appeased the angry fairy. She affected an hideous leer of
approbation, and taking the young prince by the hand, conducted him to a
neighbouring church, where they were married together in a moment. As
soon as the ceremony was performed, the prince, who was to the last
degree desirous of seeing his favourite mouse, reminded the bride of her
promise. &ldquo;To confess a truth, my prince,&rdquo; cried she,
&ldquo;I&nbsp;myself am that very white mouse you saw on your wedding
night in the royal apartment. I&nbsp;now therefore give you your choice,
whether you would have me a mouse by day, and a woman by night, or a
mouse by night, and a woman by day.&rdquo; Though the prince was an
excellent
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<!-- png 16 -->
casuist, he was quite at a loss how to determine; but at last thought it
most prudent to have recourse to a blue cat, that had followed him from
his own dominions, and frequently amused him with its conversation, and
assisted him with its advice; in fact this cat was no other than the
faithful Princess Nanhoa herself, who had shared with him all his
hardships in this disguise.</p>

<p>By her instructions he was determined in his choice; and returning to
the old fairy, prudently observed, that, as she must have been sensible
he had married her only for the sake of what she had, and not for her
personal qualifications, he thought it would, for several reasons, be
most convenient if she continued a woman by day, and appeared a mouse by
night.</p>

alt = "Husband in bed, wife with two porcupines holding her train"></p>
<!-- png 19 -->

<p>The old fairy was a good deal mortified at her husband&rsquo;s want
of gallantry, though she was reluctantly obliged to comply; the day was
therefore spent in the most polite amusement, the gentlemen talked, the
ladies laughed, and were angry. At last the happy
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<!-- png 17 -->
night drew near; the blue cat still stuck by the side of its master, and
even followed him to the bridal apartment. Barbacela entered the
chamber, wearing a train fifteen yards long, supported by porcupines,
and all over beset with jewels, which served to render her more
detestable. She was just stepping into bed to the prince, forgetting her
promise, when he insisted on seeing her in the shape of a mouse. She had
promised, and no fairy can break her word; wherefore, assuming the
figure of the most beautiful mouse in the world, she skipped and played
about with an infinity of amusement. The prince, in an agony of rapture,
was desirous of seeing his pretty play-fellow move a slow dance about
the floor to his own singing; he began to sing, and the mouse
immediately to perform with the most perfect knowledge of time, and the
finest grace, and greatest gravity imaginable; it only began, for
Nanhoa, who had long waited for the opportunity, in the shape of a cat,
flew upon it instantly without remorse, and eating it up in the
hundredth
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<span class = "pagenum folio">4</span>
<!-- png 22 -->
part of a moment, broke the charm, and then resumed her natural
figure.</p>

<p>The prince now found that he had all along been under the power of
enchantment; that his passion for the white mouse was entirely
fictitious, and not the genuine complexion of his soul; he now saw, that
his earnestness after mice was an illiberal amusement, and much more
becoming a rat-catcher than a prince. All his meannesses now stared him
in the face; he begged the princess&rsquo;s pardon an hundred times. The
princess very readily forgave him; and both returning to their palace at
Bonbobbin, lived very happily together, and reigned many years, with all
that wisdom, which, by the story, they appear to have been possessed of;
perfectly convinced by their former adventures, that they who place
their affections on trifles at first for amusement, will find these
trifles at last become their most serious concern.</p>

<span class = "smaller">HIM THAT HE ENVIED.</span></h3>

<p class = "backline small">&nbsp;</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">In</span> a considerable town, two persons
dwelt next door to one another; one of them conceived such a violent
hatred against the other, that he who was hated resolved to remove his
dwelling farther off, being persuaded that their being neighbours was
the only cause from whence his animosity did arise; for though he had
done him several pieces of service, he found, nevertheless, that his
hatred was nothing diminished; therefore he sold his house, with what
goods he had left, and retired to the capital city of that kingdom,
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<!-- png 24 -->
which was not far distant. He bought a little spot of ground which lay
about half a league from the city; he had a house convenient enough,
with a fine garden, and a pretty spacious court, wherein was a deep
well, which was not in use.</p>

<p>The honest man, having made this purchase, put on a dervise&rsquo;s
or monk&rsquo;s habit, to lead a retired life, and caused several cells
to be made in the house, where, in a short time, he established a
numerous society of dervises; he came soon to be publicly known by his
virtue, through which he acquired the esteem of a great many people, as
well of the commonalty, as of the chief of the city. In short, he was
extremely honoured and cherished by every one. People came from afar to
recommend themselves to his prayers; and all those who came to live with
him published what blessings they received through his means.</p>

<p>The great reputation of this honest man having spread to the town
from whence he came, it touched the envious man so much to
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<!-- png 25 -->
the quick, that he left his house and affairs, with a resolution to go
and ruin him. With this intent he went to the new convent of dervises,
of which his former neighbour was the head, who received him with all
imaginable tokens of friendship. The envious man told him that he was
come on purpose to communicate a business of importance to him, which he
could not do but in private; and in order that nobody may hear us, let
us, says he, take a walk in your court, and seeing night begins to draw
on, command your dervises to retire to their cells. The head of the
dervises did as he required.</p>

<p>When the envious man saw that he was alone with this good man, he
began to tell him his errand, walking side by side in the court, until
he saw his opportunity; and getting the good man near the brink of the
well, he gave him a thrust, and pushed him into it, without any body
being witness to so wicked an action. Having done this, he marched off
immediately, got out at the gate of the convent, without being known to
any one, and came
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<!-- png 26 -->
home to his own house, well satisfied with his journey; being fully
persuaded that the object of his hatred was no more in this world; but
he found himself highly mistaken.</p>

<p>This old well was inhabited by fairies and genies, which happened
very luckily for the relief of the head of the convent; for they
received and supported him, and carried him to the bottom, so that he
got no hurt. He perceived well enough that there was something
extraordinary in his fall, which must otherwise have cost him his life;
whereas he neither saw nor felt any thing. But he soon heard a voice,
which said, &ldquo;Do you know what honest man this is to whom we have
done this piece of service?&rdquo; Another voice answered,
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; To which the first replied, &ldquo;Then I will tell
you. This man, out of charity, the greatest that ever was known, left
the town he lived in, and has established himself in this place, in
hopes to cure one of his neighbours of the envy he had conceived against
him; he has acquired such general esteem, that the envious man, not able
to
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<!-- png 27 -->
endure it, came hither on purpose to ruin him, which he had performed,
had it not been for the assistance which we have given this honest man,
whose reputation is so great, that the sultan, who keeps his residence
in the neighbouring city, was to pay him a visit tomorrow, and to
recommend the princess, his daughter, to his prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another voice asked, &ldquo;What need had the princess of the
dervise&rsquo;s prayers?&rdquo; To which the first answered, &ldquo;You
do not know, it seems, that she is possessed by Genie Maimoun, the son
of Dimdim, who is fallen in love with her. But I know well how this good
head of the dervises may cure her; the thing is very easy, and I will
tell it you. He has a black cat in his convent, with a white spot at the
end of her tail, about the bigness of a small piece of English money;
let him only pull seven hairs out of this white spot, burn them, and
smoke the princess&rsquo;s head with the fume, she will not only be
presently cured, but be so safely delivered from
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<!-- png 28 -->
Maimoun, the son of Dimdim, that he will never dare to come near her a
second time<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>The head of the dervises remembered every word of the discourse between the
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'faries' ('fairy' and 'fairies' occur many times)">fairies</ins>
and the genies, who were very silent all the night after. The next
morning, by break of day, when he could discern one thing from another,
the well being broken down in several places, he saw a hole, by which he
crept out with ease.</p>

<p>The other dervises, who had been seeking for him, were rejoiced to
see him. He gave them a brief account of the wickedness of that man to
whom he had given so kind a reception the day before, and retired to his
cell. It was not long till the black cat, of which the fairies and the
genies had made mention in their discourses the night before, came to
fawn upon her master, as she was accustomed to do: he took her up, and
pulled seven hairs out of the white spot that was upon her tail, and
laid them aside for his use, when occasion should serve.</p>

<p>The sun was not high, when the sultan,
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<!-- png 29 -->
who would leave no means untried that he thought could restore the
princess to her perfect health, arrived at the gate of the convent. He
commanded his guards to halt, whilst he, with his principal officers,
went in. The dervises received him with profound respect.</p>

<p>The sultan called their head aside, and said, &ldquo;Good Scheich, it
may be, you know already the cause of my coming hither.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replies he, very gravely, &ldquo;if I do not
mistake it, it is the disease of the princess which procures this honour
that I have not deserved.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is the very thing,&rdquo;
replied the sultan. &ldquo;You will give me new life, if your prayers,
as I hope they will, can procure my daughter&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;if your majesty will be
pleased to let her come hither, I&nbsp;am in hopes, through God&rsquo;s
assistance and favour, she shall return in perfect health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince, transported with joy, sent immediately to fetch his
daughter, who very soon appeared with a numerous train of ladies and
eunuchs, but masked, so that her face was
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<!-- png 30 -->
not seen. The chief of the dervises caused a pall to be held over her
head, and he had no sooner thrown the seven tufts of hair upon the
burning coals, but the genie Maimoun, the son of Dimdim, gave a great
cry, without any thing being seen, and left the princess at liberty;
upon which she took the veil from off her face, and rose up to see where
she was, saying, &ldquo;Where am I, and who brought me hither?&rdquo; At
these words the sultan, overcome with excess of joy, embraced his
daughter, and kissed her eyes; he also kissed the chief of the
dervises&rsquo; hands, and said to his officers, &ldquo;Tell me your
opinion, what reward does he deserve who has thus cured my
daughter?&rdquo; They all cried, &ldquo;He deserves her in
marriage.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is what I had in my thoughts,&rdquo; said
the sultan, &ldquo;and I make him my son-in-law from this moment.&rdquo;
Some time after, the prime visier died, and the sultan conferred the
place on the dervise. The sultan himself died without heirs-male; upon
which the religious orders and the militia gathered together, and the
honest man
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<!-- png 31 -->
was declared and acknowledged sultan by general consent.</p>

<p>The honest dervise being mounted on the throne of his father-in-law,
as he was one day in the midst of his courtiers upon a march, he espied
the envious man among the crowd of people that stood as he passed along,
and calling one of his visiers that attended him, whispered him in the
ear thus: &ldquo;Go, bring me that man you see there, but take care you
do not frighten him.&rdquo; The visier obeyed; and when the envious man
was brought into his presence, the sultan said, &ldquo;Friend, I&nbsp;am
extremely glad to see you.&rdquo; Upon which he called an officer,
&ldquo;Go immediately,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and cause to be paid this
man out of my treasury one hundred pieces of gold; let him have also twenty
<ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: may be normal for 1816">load</ins>
of the richest merchandise in my store-houses, and
a sufficient guard to conduct him to his house.&rdquo; After he had
given this charge to the officer, he bid the envious man farewell, and
proceeded on his march.</p>

<span class = "firstword">It</span> is generally known, that Tom
Two-Shoes went to sea when he was a very little boy, and very poor; and
that he returned a very great man, and very rich; but no one knows how
he acquired so much wealth but himself and a few friends.</p>

<p>After Tom had been at sea some years, he was unfortunately cast away
on that part of Africa inhabited by the Hottentots. Here he met with a
strange book, which the Hottentots did not understand, and which gave
him some account of Prester John&rsquo;s country;
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<!-- png 33 -->
and being a lad of great curiosity and resolution, he determined to see
it; accordingly he set out on the pursuit, attended by a young lion,
which he had tamed, and made so fond of him, that he followed him like a
dog, and obeyed all his commands; and indeed it was happy for him that
he had such a companion; for, as his road lay through large woods and
forests, that were full of wild beasts, and without inhabitants, he must
have been soon starved or torn in pieces, had he not been both fed and
protected by this noble animal.</p>

<p>Tom had provided himself with two guns, a sword, and as much powder
and ball as he could carry: with these arms, and such a companion, it
was mighty easy for him to get food; for the animals in these wild and
extensive forests, having never seen the effects of a gun, readily ran
from the lion, who hunted on one side, to Tom, who hunted on the other,
so that they were either caught by the lion, or shot by his master; and
it was pleasant enough, after a hunting-match, and the
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<!-- png 34 -->
meat was dressed, to see how cheek by jowl they sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>When they came to the land of Utopia, he discovered the statue of a
man erected on an open plain, which had this inscription on the
pedestal: &ldquo;On May-day in the morning, when the sun rises,
I&nbsp;shall have a <i>Head of Gold</i>.&rdquo; As it was now the latter
end of April, he staid to see this wonderful change; and, in the mean
time, inquiring of a poor shepherd what was the reason of the statue
being erected there, and with that inscription, he was informed, that it
was set up many years ago by an Arabian philosopher, who travelled all
the world over in search of a real friend, that he lived with, and was
extremely fond of, a&nbsp;great man who inhabited the next mountain; but
that on some occasion they quarrelled, and the philosopher, leaving the
mountain, retired into the plain, where he erected this statue with his
own hands, and soon after died. To this he added, that all the people
for many leagues round came there every
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<!-- png 35 -->
May morning, expecting to see the stone head turned to gold.</p>

<p>Tom got up very early on the first of May to behold this amazing
change, and when he came near the statue, he saw a number of people, who
all ran away from him in the utmost consternation, having never before
seen a lion follow a man like a lap-dog. Being thus left alone, he fixed
his eyes on the sun, then rising with resplendent majesty, and
afterwards turned to the statue, but could see no change in the
stone.&mdash;&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; says he to himself, &ldquo;there is
some mystical meaning in this! This inscription must be an &aelig;nigma,
the hidden meaning of which I will endeavour to find; for a philosopher
never would expect a stone to be turned to gold.&rdquo; Accordingly he
measured the length of the shadow, which the statue gave on the ground
by the sun shining on it, and marked that particular part where the head
fell; then getting a chopness, a&nbsp;thing like a spade, and digging,
he discovered a copper chest, full of gold,
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<!-- png 36 -->
with this inscription engraved on the lid of it, &ldquo;Thy <i>wit</i>,
oh man! whoever thou art, hath disclosed the &aelig;nigma, and
discovered the <i>Golden Head</i>. Take it and use it: but use it with
wisdom; for know, that <i>Gold</i>, properly employed, may dispense
blessings, and promote the happiness of mortals; but when hoarded up, or
misapplied, is but trash, that makes mankind miserable. Remember the
unprofitable servant, who hid his <i>talent</i> in a napkin; and the
profligate son who squandered away his substance, and fed with the
swine. As thou hast got the <i>Golden Head</i>, observe the <i>Golden
Mean</i>; be <i>good</i>, and be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This lesson, coming as it were from the dead, struck him with such an
awe and reverence for piety and virtue, that before he removed the
treasure, he kneeled down, and earnestly and fervently prayed that he
might make a prudent, just and proper use of it. He then conveyed the
chest away; but how he got it to England is not known. It may not be
improper, however, in this place, to
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<!-- png 37 -->
give the reader some account of the philosopher who hid this treasure,
and took so much pains to find a true and real friend to enjoy it. As
Tom had reason to venerate his memory, he was very particular in his
inquiry, and had this character of him: That he was a man well
acquainted with nature and with trade; that he was pious, friendly, and
of a sweet and affable disposition; that he had acquired a fortune by
commerce, and having no relation to leave it to, he travelled through
Arabia, Persia, India, Lybia, and Utopia, in search of a real friend. In
this pursuit he found several, with whom he had exchanged good offices,
and who were polite and obliging; but they often flew off for trifles,
or as soon as he pretended to be in distress, and requested their
assistance, had left him to struggle with his own difficulties. So true
is that copy in our books, which says, &ldquo;Adversity is the
touchstone of friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, however, he met in with the Utopian Philosopher, or the Wise
Man of the Mountain, as he is called, and thought in him he had found
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<!-- png 38 -->
the friend he wanted; for though he had often pretended to be in
distress, and abandoned to the frowns of fortune, this man always
relieved him, and with such chearfulness and sincerity, that concluding
he had found out the only man to whom he ought to open both his purse
and his heart, he let him so far into his secrets, as to desire his
assistance in hiding a large sum of money, which he wanted to conceal,
lest the prince of the country, who was absolute, should, by the advice
of his wicked minister, put him to death for his gold. The two
philosophers met and hid the money, which the stranger, after some days,
went to see, but found it gone. How was he struck to the heart, when he
found that his friend, whom he had often tried, and who had relieved him
in his distress, could not withstand this temptation, but broke through
the sacred bonds of friendship, and turned even a thief for gold which
he did not want, as he was already very rich! &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what is the heart of man made of? Why am I condemned to live
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<!-- png 39 -->
among people who have no sincerity, and barter the most sacred ties of
friendship and humanity for the dirt that we tread on? Had I lost my
gold, and found a real friend, I&nbsp;should have been happy with the
exchange, but now I am most miserable.&rdquo; After some time he wiped
off his tears, and being determined not to be so imposed on, he had
recourse to cunning and the arts of life. He went to his pretended
friend with a chearful countenance, told him he had more gold to hide,
and desired him to appoint a time when they might go together and open
the earth, to put it into the same pot; the other, in hopes of getting
more wealth, appointed the next evening. They went together upon the
ground, and found the money they had first placed there, for the artful
wretch he so much confided in, had conveyed it again into the pot, in
order to obtain more. Our philosopher immediately took the gold, and
putting it into his pocket, told the other he had now altered his mind,
and should bury it no more, till he
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<!-- png 40 -->
found a man more worthy of his confidence. See what people lose by being
dishonest!</p>


<p class = "space">
Remember this story, and take care whom you trust; but do not be
covetous, sordid, and miserable; for the gold we have, is but lent us to
do good with. We receive all from the hand of God, and every person in
distress hath a just title to a portion of&nbsp;it.</p>
